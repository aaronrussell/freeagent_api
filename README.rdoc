= freeagent_api

Simple Ruby interface to the Freeagent Central API (http://www.freeagentcentral.com/developers/freeagent-api).

This is an early development version of a Ruby wrapper for the Freeagent API. Currently this only supports GET requests (POST will follow shortly) and only the following API methods are supported (more will follow):

* Contacts
* Invoices
* Invoice items
* Projects
* Tasks
* Timeslips

There is no test suite yet. If you feel brave, then feel free to clone, fork and play around.
